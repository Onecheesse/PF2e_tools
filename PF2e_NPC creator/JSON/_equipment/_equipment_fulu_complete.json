                "value": "<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour</p><hr /><p>First used by celestial-touched nephilim of Tianjing to weaken qlippoth, an anathema fulu comes in four pieces, one placed in each cardinal direction. Choose one of the following traits when activating the fulus: celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, monitor, or undead. If a creature with that trait starts its turn in the area, it must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|dc:30] saving throw or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2} until the start of its next turn. On a critical success, the creature becomes temporarily immune to any anathema fulus for 1 hour. Regardless of the save result, if you subsequently cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Banishment] on such a creature in the area, the creature takes the –2 penalty described in that spell for adding a special cost of an object that's anathema to that creature. The fulu acts as that object; you don't need to add it. If a creature affected by this penalty rolls a saving throw against <em>banishment</em>, the caster can use a free action to force the result one step lower. Doing so burns the whole fulu out, ending the effect. If any of the fulu's pieces are moved or destroyed after activation, the effect ends.</p>"

Once, a traveler saved an eight-legged feline who turned out to be a poracha prince. In return, the prince gave the traveler a fulu that later prevented a fast-acting poison from slaying them. Traditionally, one wears a string of up to nine <em>poracha fulus</em>, which counts as one talisman. Each time you take persistent damage, one <em>poracha fulu</em> affixed to you negates the damage and crumbles to dust. This response is automatic, but you can use a free action (envision) to prevent your fulus from responding. If you do, any <em>poracha fulus</em> affixed to you never respond to that persistent damage.</p>"

When you activate the fulu, it takes the shape of a Tiny humanoid guard made of paper and keeps watch over an area in a 20-foot burst. The guard has a Perception DC of 20, along with precise visual senses and imprecise hearing and vibrational sense to detect creatures moving in its area, including through the air. You dictate whether the guard remains still in its area or patrols it; if the latter, you also determine the path the guard takes, at a Speed of 25 feet. You also determine a password others must give the guard to bypass it. If a creature enters the area without giving the password, the sentry creates either an audible or mental alarm. An audible alarm has the sound and volume of a human shouting, as well as the auditory trait, allowing each creature that can hear it to attempt a @Check[perception|dc:15] check to wake up if they're asleep. The mental alert reaches you if you're within 60 feet of the active guard (see below). The guard remains active for 8 hours, and then the fulu is consumed.</p>\n<p>If you have more than one sentry fulu, you can set up several that function as a unit, provided their areas touch or overlap. When one sounds its alarm, the alarm passes through all of them, so you must be within range of only one to hear it or receive the mental alert. Creatures that give the correct password to one sentry fulu in a unit need not give that password again to the others. The destruction of one fulu-created guard in a unit sets off the alarm in others in connected areas.</p>"
